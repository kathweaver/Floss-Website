                        <p>WELCOME to the website of Shade Tree Beagles. We are located in Southeast Iowa.</p>

                        <p>Shade Tree Kennels was established in 1990 when we acquired our first cocker spaniel—”Billger’s Presidential John Quincy”. In 2003 we added a beagle to the mix name K-Run Windkist Four on the Floor. In 2007 we had our first litter from Brach and Salli.</p>

                        <p>My first show dogs were cocker spaniels. Mick, a parti-color, still resides with us and is our last cocker spaniel. The Shade Tree kennel name was conceived by my mother. We have a very large tree that the kennel is built around. This large shade tree gives much needed shade and protection to the runs and kennels.</p>

                        <p>I am relatively new to the beagle world, but have fallen in love with this spirited, loving breed. I have wanted to be a part of this breed for a long time and am very happy to have made the transition from cocker spaniels to beagles. Both are great breeds to have in your life.</p>

                        <p>I would like to thank the following people for their
                        guidance, friendship and patience in helping me in the dog world. Connie Bennett—Homespun Cockers; Vicki
                        Armstrong—Romancin’s Cockers; Kathy Weichert— K-Run
                        Beagles; Chuck and Donna Kitchell—Chardon Beagles;
                        Margaret and the late Jim Milne—Milne’s Beagles; and Terri Voss– Misty Hollow.</p>
