                    <p>WELCOME to the website of Shade Tree Beagles. We are located in Southeast Iowa.</p>

                    <p>Shade Tree Kennels was established in 1990 when we acquired our first cocker spaniel—”Billger’s Presidential John Quincy”. In 2003 we added a beagle to the mix name K-Run Windkist Four on the Floor. In 2007 we had our first litter from Brach and Salli.</p>

                    <p>My first show dogs were cocker spaniels. The Shade Tree kennel name was conceived by my mother. We have a very large tree that the kennel is built around. This large shade tree gives much needed shade and protection to the runs and kennels.</p>

                    <p>I have been in beagle world for 15 years, and have fallen in love with this spirited, loving breed. I have wanted to be a part of this breed for a long time and am very happy to have made the transition from cocker spaniels to beagles. Both are great breeds to have in your life.</p>

                    <p>I would like to thank the following people for their
                    guidance, friendship and patience in helping me in the dog world:</p>
